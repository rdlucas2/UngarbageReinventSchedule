# UngarbageReinventSchedule
The reinvent scheduler/calendar is garbage.

### Setup:
Make a local.env file, using example.env as a template. Grab your bearer token from the dev tools in your browser when logged into the reinvent site.

#### Loading events:
events.json file is excluded, but can be generated by the /api/seed-events route. seed-events allows you to load/reload YOUR data if you register/favorite etc.

### Build with docker:
```
docker build -t ungarbage .
docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)\src:/usr/src/app" --env-file local.env -p 8000:8000 --name=ungarbage ungarbage
```

### TODO:
- find a calendar plugin for index page to display events
- make events exportable to outlook and/or google calendar (ics format?)
- add more api functionality, searchability of events
- in dockerfile - change the web layer to develop - and then make a deploy layer, that doesn't reload on save, and doesn't require mounting the volume (copies source files over)
